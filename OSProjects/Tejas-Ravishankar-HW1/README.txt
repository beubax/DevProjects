This package includes the following files-

|--Starter.c
Is the starting file which allows for command line arguments. This is the one which sets the rand seed. It calls the main 'get-running-ratio' function and displays the average ratio.

|--Executor.c
Contains the auxiliary functions 'get-iteration-no', 'get_arr_size', 'get_arr_val', 'ratio' and the main function 'get_running_ratio'. Performs a random number of iterations, with a random array size each time and outputs the average vowel-to-consonant ratio alongside the iteration number which contains the maximum number of vowels. Allocated the array memory in the heap and then frees it up at the end of each iteration.

|--Executor.h
Contains the method exposed from Executor.c

|--Makefile
Has a build and clean option which compiles the files and removes the output respectively. Has placeholder values for the file names and function calls.
